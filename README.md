# Heart-Disease---Final-Project
Final Project Bootcamp - Heart Disease

Heart disease includes several conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, interfering with the heart's normal function. For the body to work properly, the circulatory system—which consists of the heart acting as a pump and a network of blood vessels—must function well. However, heart disease often goes unnoticed for a long time because it doesn’t show any symptoms.

The aim of this project is to detect the possibility to have a heart disease depending on the following features:
Age; 
Gender; 
Chest pain type; 
Resting blood pressure; 
Serum cholesterol; 
Fasting blood sugar; 
Resting electrocardiogram results; 
Maximum heart rate achieved; 
Exercise induced angina; 
Oldpeak = ST; 
Slope of the peak exercise ST segment; 
Number of major vessels.
